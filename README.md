# Lolzteam ChatGPT Answer Python Script [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-1.0-blue?link=LolzteamChatGPTAnswer)](https://github.com/llimonix/LolzteamChatGPTAnswer/releases/latest)
Automatic response via CHATGPT in new topics in any section of the forum

Guide to work:
1. Download and install python from the off site [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. Download the archive and unzip it
3. Run the **install_pip.bat**, it will install the necessary modules
4. Open **test.py** in any convenient way for editing and editing forum_id and token_lolz on their own.
5. Close the editor and run **start.bat**
6. Voila, everything works (probably if everything is done correctly. I will not help to understand everything, I have painted everything)

Where to get a token (DON'T GIVE IT TO ANYONE):
You need to create it on this page: API
1. Create an application with any name, any description and any link
2. Click on **"Get token"** and select the previously created application
3. Choose all the items or you can remove the market
4. A page opens with the created token, copy it and paste it into the script
